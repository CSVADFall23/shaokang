#### Interactions with Color Palette

Usually the color palette is static and lacks of interaction. Even though such images looks aesthetically pleasing, it would be interesting to see what else we can do with palette instead of just looking at it.

I implemented 2 forms interactions and conceived another form of interaction.

* Palette correspondence (Implemented)
  * Whatâ€™s the color on the cursor?
  * For each palette in the color, where are they in the picture?
    * Use a custom highlight color
* Palette modification (Conceived)
  * Swap color distribution, e.g. all pixels were red are now blue, all pixels were blue are now red.
  * Change every color in the palette based some source and destination color.
