## Project 6 Generative Image

The overall asthetics I’m trying to achieve is from an idea of DreamCore. It involves nostalgia, but also with some level of surrealism. And I used Midjourney for the image generation.

To make sure the result is close to what I want, I added the link of the reference photo to the prompt. And also added some “magical spell” to the prompt.

```

One thing I notice is that, even though I described the image should come with noise and dim lighting, the resulted image still looks clean and bright. So I have to manually process them in Lightroom. The steps I took are

1. Add noise
2. Lower the saturation
3. Add color filter to make it more “nostalgic”
4. Rotate the image a little bit, so it looks not that upright.
